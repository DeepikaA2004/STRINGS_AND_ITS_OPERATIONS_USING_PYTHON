# STRINGS_AND_ITS_OPERATIONS_USING_PYTHON
To write a Python program to check whether the second string can be obtained from the first by deletion of none, one, or more characters.

# ALGORITHM
## STEP 1:Get two strings and input from the user.
## STEP 2:Find the length of the two strings.
## STEP 3:Using for loop iterate over the two strings.
